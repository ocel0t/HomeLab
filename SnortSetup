1) Prereqs and interface check

    Update packages:

sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade

    Identify your network interface (note the one carrying LAN/Internet traffic):

ip -br addr

sudo apt install -y snort tcpdump ethtool
snort -V

3) Key file locations

    Main config (Lua): /etc/snort/snort.lua

    Rules directory: /etc/snort/rules/

    Local rules: /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

    Log directory: /var/log/snort/ (may be created on first run)
